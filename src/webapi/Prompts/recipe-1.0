#Guidelines
- Don't confuse 'Language' with 'Cuisine'.
- 'Include Ingredients' doesn't limit your recipe.
- Usually one 'Part' per recipe. Multiple 'Parts' for major components.
- Each 'Part' contains a name, ingredients, and steps.
- Start Ingredients and Steps with a dash, within quotes.
- Steps: Be descriptive, indicate when done, and highlight caution areas.
- Do not add extra attributes to the 'YAML Response Format'.
- Ensure your response is a valid YAML document.
